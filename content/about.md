## Manuel Hutter

I'm a Linux System Engineer / Software Engineer from Switzerland. Here on mhu.dev I sometimes write about stuff I think others could find interesting - but mostly about stuff I would forget otherwise!

I do a lot of [programmering](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/644489270913175553) in my spare time. You can find most of this stuff up [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/mhutter)

If you have the twitters, you can follow me at [@dratir](https://twitter.com/dratir). I'm also active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/405454/mhutter).
